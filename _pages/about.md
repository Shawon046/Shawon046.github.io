I am an MS student in Computer Science department at Virginia Tech. I am expected to graduate in December, 2025. During my MS study, I enrolled in courses focusing on machine learning and cybersecurity. For example, Machine Learning, Fundamentals of Information Security, Database Manangement Systems, Urban Computing, Statistics in Research, to name a few. I also have gained some research experience in the domain of security and privacy of machine learning models. Additionally, I explored Intrusion Detection Systems modeling with the help of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). 

I completed my undergrad from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in the Computer Science and Engineering department back in 2021. Since it is one of the topmost engineering colleges in my country, the curriculum is heavily enriched, and I was able to gather both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. Some of the notable courses would be Structural Programming(C), Object Oriented Programming (C++, Java), Data Structure and Algorithms, Digital Logic Design, Numerical Methods (MATLAB), Theory of Computation, Computer Architecture,  Compiler, Data Communication, Microprocessors, Microcontrolerss, and Embedded Systems, Operating System, Software Engineering, Information System Design, Computer Network, Computer Security, Basic Graph Theory, Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, etc. I have also had teaching experience in mentoring high school students for the most competitive national college entrance exam for as long as 5 years.

<!-- Currently, I am involved in the<a href='https://www.simstudent.org/home'> SimStudent project.</a>, a teachable agent that uses inductive logic programming to learn from students' demonstrations. My role involves generating contextually relevant questions to enhance students' critical thinking and equation-solving skills during their interactions with SimStudent.

Outside of work, I enjoy meeting new people and embracing diverse perspectives. I find joy in dancing, exploring new cultures, and discovering new hobbies. Whether through my work or personal life, I aim to live with purpose, positivity, and curiosity and welcome anyone who wants to connect or share ideas.
