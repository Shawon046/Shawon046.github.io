I am an MS student in Computer Science department at Virginia Tech. I am expected to graduate in December, 2025. During my MS study, I enrolled in courses focusing on machine learning and cybersecurity. For example, Machine Learning, Fundamentals of Information Security, Database Manangement Systems, Urban Computing, Statistics in Research, to name a few. I also have gained some research experience in the domain of security and privacy of machine learning models. Additionally, I explored Intrusion Detection Systems modeling with the help of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

Previously, I gained experience as a Research Trainee at Children’s National Medical Center during the Summer, 2024. Over there, my work was focus on exploring and exploiting the vulnerabilities of Machine Learning models deployed in medical fields. My goal was to demonstrate attacks on privacy-preserving machine learning models to harm the fairness and performance. Also, I served as a Junior Software Developer at Loosely Coupled Technologies Sdn Bhd in 2021. My role was to design front end with AngularJS and implement the server side of web applications using Node.js, along with writing web services in MSSQL through stored procedures. Moreover, I performed on (client’s) demand basis integration and development using Visual Studio. Furthermore, I efficiently communicated with the Malaysian business team to reflect the aspired changes in development

I completed my undergrad from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in the Computer Science and Engineering department back in 2021. Since it is one of the topmost engineering colleges in my country, the curriculum is heavily enriched, and I was able to gather both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience.

Some of the notable courses from my undergraduate studies would be - Structural Programming(C), Object Oriented Programming (C++, Java), Data Structure and Algorithms, Digital Logic Design, Numerical Methods (MATLAB), Theory of Computation, Computer Architecture, Compiler, Data Communication, Microprocessors, Microcontrolerss, and Embedded Systems, Operating System, Software Engineering, Information System Design, Computer Network, Computer Security, Basic Graph Theory, Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, etc.

Outside of work, I enjoy participating in different activities. Currently, I am serving as the Secretary of Student Affair for [BUETianUSA Capital region BOD](https://www.buetianusa.org/), which is a DC based alumni group for better connectivity. Previously, I served as a campus representative officer for the Arlington campus of Virginia Tech for the Graduate Student Council for a year. I enjoyed instructing Mathematics and programming to high school students for the most competitive national college entrance exam for as long as 6 years (from 2016 to 2022). I have a yellow best in taekwondo and I received the highly prestigious national-level scholarship until graduation from the Bangladesh government in Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) examination.
