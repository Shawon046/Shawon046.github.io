During my MS study, I enrolled in courses focusing on machine learning and cybersecurity. For example, Machine Learning, Fundamentals of Information Security, Urban Computing, Database Manangement Systems, Web Developement, Statistics in Research, to name a few.

Since my undergrad school is one of the topmost engineering colleges in my country, the curriculum is heavily enriched, and I was able to gather both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. Some of the notable courses from my undergraduate studies would be - Structural Programming(C), Object Oriented Programming (C++, Java), Data Structure and Algorithms, Digital Logic Design, Numerical Methods (MATLAB), Theory of Computation, Computer Architecture, Compiler, Data Communication, Microprocessors, Microcontrolerss, and Embedded Systems, Operating System, Software Engineering, Information System Design, Computer Network, Computer Security, Basic Graph Theory, Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, etc.

I enjoyed instructing Mathematics and programming to high school students for the most competitive national college entrance exam for as long as 6 years (from 2016 to 2022). Also, I participated in many government, and non government initiatives regarding teaching basic programming concepts to children in the rural area.
