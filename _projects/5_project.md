In my Pattern Recognition course, I implemented 2-class classifiers using Basic perceptron algorithm, Reward and punishment (RP) algorithm and Pocket algorithm as well as multi layer neural network. Exhaustive search, 2D logarithmic search, and Hierarchical search techniques were used for Template Matching. Also, I performed DBScan and k-means algorithms to cluster data without using any built-in library function.
