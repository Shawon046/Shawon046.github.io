This project was an outcome of two of my undergraduate courses (Information System Design and Software Engineering) I took in 2018-2019. In this project, we (a group of 3) developed a full-stack web application with DJango serving as toolkit for building Web APIs with HTML/CSS as the frontend. We used MySQL as the database for this work and followed Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC). In the earlier version of this project (back in 2017), I built a robust web application with Java and JavaFX framework with HTML/CSS as frontend. I Implemented an Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to handle data for this project.
