In my Microcontroller and Microprocessor course project, we (a group of 2) designed a PCB without using any external library. We utilized C language, and other simulation tools such as Proteus, AVRDUDE to accomplish the project. Our automated car was able to sense obstacles and deflect the movement when necessary. Also, we implemented the functionality to control the movement of the car remotely using a simple controller.
