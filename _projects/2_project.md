This project was a part of one of my graduate courses (Introduction to Urban Computing). In this project, we (a group of 2) combined ML and data analysis techniques to crime using tabular data. We handled tabular data by conducting extensive data preprocessing techniques and exploratory data analysis to deal with missing values and outliers so that the ML model is able to learn better. We made predictions using default libraries and a standard Neural Network to compare the performance. Here is the [github link](https://github.com/Shawon046/Crime-Prediction-for-Montgomery-County) to our project.
